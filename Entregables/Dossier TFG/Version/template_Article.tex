\section{Software dependencies}

All the code in this project except for the Matlab snippets were developed and compiled on QT creator 5.9 using the Microsoft visual studio 2015 64 bits compiler for Windows. Both the online and the offline pipelines require OpenCV 3.4.1. The online pipeline also requires the Basler Camera runtime V5.10 to work properly and to be able to execute it two Basler cameras have to be connected to the computer. All modules were tested on a windows 10 64 bits device.

The Matlab snippets were developed using Matlab 2015b.
