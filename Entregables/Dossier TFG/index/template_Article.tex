This project has been conveniently organized in folders:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Calibration dataset:} This folder contains the latest dataset captured to calibrate the cameras. More datasets were captured during the development of the project, but due to size constrains only one was provided.
	
	\item \textbf{Processing results:} This directory contains the output of the operations (mean, min, max) and the times to compute the process pipeline stored in csv files.  The data is split in folders, one for each processed video.
	
	\item \textbf{Spreadsheets:} Contains the spreadsheets used to analyze the data of the processing results.
	
	\item \textbf{User Testing:} This folder contain the configuration files generated in the user testing session.
	
	\item \textbf{Viewer\_exe:} The executable file for the full visualization pipeline can be found here with the required dynamic libraries (dll) and configuration files.
	
	\item \textbf{Code:} All the source code, make files and configuration files can be found inside this directory.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{CalibC:} Contains the source code of a outdated module created to develop and test the calibration modules.
		
		\item \textbf{Libelas:} Contains the source code of the offline pipeline.
		
		\item \textbf{Matlab snippets:}  Contains matlab snippets used to generate and test the results of the modules.
		
		\item \textbf{VR\_interfaz:}  Contains the source code of the visualization pipeline.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Docs:} This folder contain all the reports in both PDF and \LaTeX format.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Entrega informe inicial}
		
		\item \textbf{Primera entrega}
		
		\item \textbf{Segunda entrega} 
		
		\item \textbf{Entrega informe final}
		
		\item \textbf{Other:} Other documentation created during the project.
